# BIGDAWG
Data sets and functions for chi-squared Hardy-Weinberg and case-control
    association tests of highly polymorphic genetic data [e.g., human leukocyte antigen
    (HLA) data]. Performs association tests at multiple levels of polymorphism
    (haplotype, locus and HLA amino-acids) as described in Pappas DJ, Marin W, Hollenbach
    JA, Mack SJ (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.humimm.2015.12.006>. Combines rare variants to a 
    common class to account for sparse cells in tables as described by Hollenbach JA, 
    Mack SJ, Thomson G, Gourraud PA (2012) <doi:10.1007/978-1-61779-842-9_14>.
